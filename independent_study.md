https://www.elsevier.com/journals/renewable-and-sustainable-energy-reviews/1364-0321/guide-for-authors

# 1. Introduction

Electrification trend vs. other fuels

How the grid works - supply, demand

How do GEBs fit in to recent trends, needs

# Methods and materials

## Literature review

IN PROGRESS

## Data

Identify data sources to test and use for future analysis.

Use [OpenStudio Standards](https://github.com/NREL/openstudio-standards) to generate [DOE Commercial Reference Buildings](https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/commercial-reference-buildings).

* [U.S. Department of Energy Commercial Reference Building Models of the National Building Stock](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy11osti/46861.pdf)

  * Weighting factors (new construction only) indicate that Small Office is the most common building type across all climate zones.
