## Description and Goals

The independent study topic will be a literature review to categorize measures and technologies that are suitable for grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEB), which will inform later analysis during Master's Report (AREN 6960). The general goals of the independent study will be the following.

* Review current literature and research
* Develop purpose, scope, and objectives for later analysis
* Develop work plan and schedule for later analysis

## Methods and Evaluation

The independent study methods will include the goals above, which will be evaluated based on a final report delivered to the faculty member on or before the end of the semester. Regular meetings with the faculty member will be scheduled as needed.

## Purpose / Problem Statement


## Scope

Building sector - target most common?
* Commercial
* Residential

Building type - target most common (office)?
* All or single?

Climate zone - most common, 3-4?
* All or single?

Scale of simulations
* Single sector, building type, and climate zone
* Large-scale analysis?

Existing research
* Lots going on at national labs, e.g. NREL
* Avoid overlap and target gaps

Measure categories
* Organize by design disciplines: Architectural, Electrical, Mechanical, Plumbing

Metrics
* $/kW PV vs % savings
* $/kW PV vs $/kW savings (objective function, max - min)
* Flatten profile
* LCC (utility cost) vs % savings - EE, ZNE (traditional BEOpt cost function)
* Energy savings cost function
* Three cost functions to identify best gaps
* X-axis EE, y-axis cost function
* SA of cost?

Perspective
* Building owner - utility cost (demand savings)
* Energy Efficiency vs. Renewable Energy investment
  * More data
* Electric utility - load shape (peak demand reduction)
* Energy Efficiency vs. Renewable Energy investment
  * Both?
* Related to cost functions
