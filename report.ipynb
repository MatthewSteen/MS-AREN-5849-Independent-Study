    "## Description and Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent study topic will be a literature review to categorize measures and technologies that are suitable for grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEB), which will inform later analysis during Master's Report (AREN 6960). The general goals of the independent study will be the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Review current literature and research\n",
    "* Develop purpose, scope, and objectives for later analysis\n",
    "* Develop work plan and schedule for later analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Methods and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The independent study methods will include the goals above, which will be evaluated based on a final report delivered to the faculty member on or before the end of the semester. Regular meetings with the faculty member will be scheduled as needed.\n",
