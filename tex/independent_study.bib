The attributes reviewed for the end uses being considered are response frequency, response time, the need for and impacts of energy pre- or recharge, the cost of enabling a resource to respond to a load-curtailment signal, and the magnitude of load curtailment in a given resource. We also describe controls and communications technologies that can enable end uses to participate in DR programs. The characterization was initially developed as a foundational work to quantify hourly availability of DR resources from the selected end uses followed by a multi-laboratory effort that quantified DR's value within the Western Interconnectiona.

author = {Biswas, Kaushik and Shrestha, Som S. and Hun, Diana E. and Atchley, Jerald},
abstractNote = {This article describes a novel application of thermal anisotropy for improving the energy efficiency of building envelopes. The current work was inspired by existing research on improved heat dissipation in electronics using thermal anisotropy. Past work has shown that thermally anisotropic composites (TACs) can be created by the alternate layering of two dissimilar, isotropic materials. Here, a TAC consisting of alternate layers of rigid foam insulation and thin, high-conductivity aluminum foil was investigated. The TAC was coupled with copper tubes with circulating water that acted as a heat sink and source. The TAC system was applied to a conventional wood-framed wall assembly, and the energy benefits were investigated experimentally and numerically. For experimental testing, large scale test wall specimens were built with and without the TAC system and tested in an environmental chamber under simulated diurnal hot and cold weather conditions. Component-level and whole building numerical simulations were performed to investigate the energy benefits of applying the TAC system to the external walls of a typical, single-family residential building.},

Zhai et al. solve this riddle by constructing a metamaterial composed of a polymer layer embedded with microspheres, backed with a thin layer of silver (see the Perspective by Zhang). The result is an easy-to-manufacture material near the theoretical limit for daytime radiative cooling. The translucent and flexible film can be made in large quantities for a variety of energy technology applications.Science, this issue p. 1062; see also p. 1023Passive radiative cooling draws heat from surfaces and radiates it into space as infrared radiation to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting radiative cooling as a viable energy technology.},

Combined with the measured optical and electrical characteristics of the PV laminate, an integrated model was developed to simulate the overall energy performance of the PV IGU in EnergyPlus. Outdoor experiments were conducted to validate the accuracy of the simulation model. The proper consistency between the simulation results and the experimental data indicated that the simulation model was reliable for predicting the overall energy performance of PV IGU. With the validated model, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the influences of air gap depth and rear side glass, and an optimal design scheme was proposed to maximize the energy efficiency of PV IGU in Hong Kong. Finally, the energy saving potential of the optimized PV IGU compared to the other commonly used window systems was evaluated. It was found that the energy saving potential of the optimized PV IGU was 25.3% and 10.7%, respectively, compared to the single clear glass window and the Low-E glass window. The methodology developed in this study is expected to provide a useful reference for simulating the energy performance of PV IGU."

The energy saving potential of the proposed system versus a conventional VAV (variable air volume) system is predicted via a series of energy simulations using TRNSYS 16 and a commercial equation solver program. Impact of water-side free cooling and solar thermal system on the operating energy saving of the liquid desiccant system is quantitatively evaluated. Simulation results showed that the proposed system consumes 51% less cooling energy compared to the conventional VAV system; primarily due to the water-side free cooling in maintaining the absorber temperature of the liquid desiccant system. The solar water heating system for regenerating the desiccant solution also contributes to the reduction in operating energy."

The seasonal mode of operation of the proposed system is also suggested and used for estimating the energy saving potentials. The TRNSYS 16 program integrated with a commercial equation solver is used for the energy simulation of the proposed system, and then two existing air handling alternatives: a conventional variable air volume (VAV) system and an existing evaporative-cooling-assisted system are compared with the proposed system. The proposed system shows operating energy savings of 82% over the conventional VAV system during the summer, and 54% and 37% in the winter and the intermediate season operations, respectively. Ultimately, the proposed system provides 68% annual operating energy saving over the conventional VAV system, and 23% savings compared to the established evaporative-cooling-assisted system. It is also found that the extreme energy benefit can be obtained by enhancing the evaporative cooling effects using the liquid desiccant (LD) unit. The operating energy saving of the LD unit can be achieved by applying the water-side free cooling and the solar thermal system."

The proposed dedicated outdoor air system consists of an enthalpy wheel, a desiccant wheel, and the thermoelectric heat pump to condition the introduced outdoor air to provide required ventilation air to the conditioned zone at neutral temperature, while the reference system consists of a desiccant wheel, a sensible heat exchanger, a cooling coil, and a regeneration air heater. To develop an empirical model for the thermoelectric heat pump applicable to the energy simulation of the proposed system, a thermoelectric heat pump prototype was built, and its operating data were collected in a fully controlled laboratory environment. By integrating the existing models of each system component used in both dedicated outdoor air systems, detailed energy simulations were performed to compare the energy performance of the proposed dedicated outdoor air system with the reference system. The results showed that the proposed system assisted by the thermoelectric heat pump consumed 23% more operating energy than the reference system because of the lower coefficient of performance of the thermoelectric heat pump compared with the conventional vapor compression system. For comparable energy performance, the proposed dedicated outdoor air system should have heat exchange effectiveness values greater than 49% at least at both the process and secondary air channels of the thermoelectric heat pump, and the figure of merit of the thermoelectric modules used in the thermoelectric heat pump should be over 1.35."

The theoretical and empirical models for each component were used to estimate the energy performance of a VAV system and a DOAS with CRCP. Additionally, the TEM-RCP was analyzed by using the developed simulation models based on the semi-black box model. Hourly simulations were conducted to measure the annual energy performance. The results indicated that the DOAS with a TEM-RCP consumed 40.7% less operating energy annually when compared with that of the conventional VAV system while the proposed system exhibited only 1.0% more annual energy consumption when compared with the DOAS with hydraulic CRCP given the relatively low dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of the TEMs (i.e., 0.73) that is used in the TEM-RCP. However, the average coefficient of performance (COP) of the TEM-RCP for cooling was 8.3, which is significantly higher than that of the conventional CRCP (4.6) during the operation period. This is because the TEM-RCP uses a cooling tower for heat removal, and its cooling water temperature is sufficiently low without requiring additional cooling of the TEM except during summer. Therefore, TEM maintains radiant panel temperature with low electric energy consumption. The study also indicated that if the ZT value of TEMs exceeded 0.75, then the proposed system exhibited lower annual energy consumption when compared to that of the DOAS with CRCP."
