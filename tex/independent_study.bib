The attributes reviewed for the end uses being considered are response frequency, response time, the need for and impacts of energy pre- or recharge, the cost of enabling a resource to respond to a load-curtailment signal, and the magnitude of load curtailment in a given resource. We also describe controls and communications technologies that can enable end uses to participate in DR programs. The characterization was initially developed as a foundational work to quantify hourly availability of DR resources from the selected end uses followed by a multi-laboratory effort that quantified DR's value within the Western Interconnectiona.

abstractNote = {This article describes a novel application of thermal anisotropy for improving the energy efficiency of building envelopes. The current work was inspired by existing research on improved heat dissipation in electronics using thermal anisotropy. Past work has shown that thermally anisotropic composites (TACs) can be created by the alternate layering of two dissimilar, isotropic materials. Here, a TAC consisting of alternate layers of rigid foam insulation and thin, high-conductivity aluminum foil was investigated. The TAC was coupled with copper tubes with circulating water that acted as a heat sink and source. The TAC system was applied to a conventional wood-framed wall assembly, and the energy benefits were investigated experimentally and numerically. For experimental testing, large scale test wall specimens were built with and without the TAC system and tested in an environmental chamber under simulated diurnal hot and cold weather conditions. Component-level and whole building numerical simulations were performed to investigate the energy benefits of applying the TAC system to the external walls of a typical, single-family residential building.},

Zhai et al. solve this riddle by constructing a metamaterial composed of a polymer layer embedded with microspheres, backed with a thin layer of silver (see the Perspective by Zhang). The result is an easy-to-manufacture material near the theoretical limit for daytime radiative cooling. The translucent and flexible film can be made in large quantities for a variety of energy technology applications.Science, this issue p. 1062; see also p. 1023Passive radiative cooling draws heat from surfaces and radiates it into space as infrared radiation to which the atmosphere is transparent. However, the energy density mismatch between solar irradiance and the low infrared radiation flux from a near-ambient-temperature surface requires materials that strongly emit thermal energy and barely absorb sunlight. We embedded resonant polar dielectric microspheres randomly in a polymeric matrix, resulting in a metamaterial that is fully transparent to the solar spectrum while having an infrared emissivity greater than 0.93 across the atmospheric window. When backed with a silver coating, the metamaterial shows a noontime radiative cooling power of 93 watts per square meter under direct sunshine. More critically, we demonstrated high-throughput, economical roll-to-roll manufacturing of the metamaterial, which is vital for promoting radiative cooling as a viable energy technology.},

Combined with the measured optical and electrical characteristics of the PV laminate, an integrated model was developed to simulate the overall energy performance of the PV IGU in EnergyPlus. Outdoor experiments were conducted to validate the accuracy of the simulation model. The proper consistency between the simulation results and the experimental data indicated that the simulation model was reliable for predicting the overall energy performance of PV IGU. With the validated model, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the influences of air gap depth and rear side glass, and an optimal design scheme was proposed to maximize the energy efficiency of PV IGU in Hong Kong. Finally, the energy saving potential of the optimized PV IGU compared to the other commonly used window systems was evaluated. It was found that the energy saving potential of the optimized PV IGU was 25.3% and 10.7%, respectively, compared to the single clear glass window and the Low-E glass window. The methodology developed in this study is expected to provide a useful reference for simulating the energy performance of PV IGU."

Impact of water-side free cooling and solar thermal system on the operating energy saving of the liquid desiccant system is quantitatively evaluated. Simulation results showed that the proposed system consumes 51% less cooling energy compared to the conventional VAV system; primarily due to the water-side free cooling in maintaining the absorber temperature of the liquid desiccant system. The solar water heating system for regenerating the desiccant solution also contributes to the reduction in operating energy."

The proposed system shows operating energy savings of 82% over the conventional VAV system during the summer, and 54% and 37% in the winter and the intermediate season operations, respectively. Ultimately, the proposed system provides 68% annual operating energy saving over the conventional VAV system, and 23% savings compared to the established evaporative-cooling-assisted system.

The results showed that the proposed system assisted by the thermoelectric heat pump consumed 23% more operating energy than the reference system because of the lower coefficient of performance of the thermoelectric heat pump compared with the conventional vapor compression system.

The theoretical and empirical models for each component were used to estimate the energy performance of a VAV system and a DOAS with CRCP. Additionally, the TEM-RCP was analyzed by using the developed simulation models based on the semi-black box model. Hourly simulations were conducted to measure the annual energy performance. The results indicated that the DOAS with a TEM-RCP consumed 40.7% less operating energy annually when compared with that of the conventional VAV system while the proposed system exhibited only 1.0% more annual energy consumption when compared with the DOAS with hydraulic CRCP given the relatively low dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of the TEMs (i.e., 0.73) that is used in the TEM-RCP. However, the average coefficient of performance (COP) of the TEM-RCP for cooling was 8.3, which is significantly higher than that of the conventional CRCP (4.6) during the operation period. This is because the TEM-RCP uses a cooling tower for heat removal, and its cooling water temperature is sufficiently low without requiring additional cooling of the TEM except during summer. Therefore, TEM maintains radiant panel temperature with low electric energy consumption. The study also indicated that if the ZT value of TEMs exceeded 0.75, then the proposed system exhibited lower annual energy consumption when compared to that of the DOAS with CRCP."

abstract = "Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for more than half of the residential energy consumption in the United States. Since most people do not have the expertise to control the HVAC system efficiently, unnecessary energy consumption is often caused by wasteful behaviors (overheating/overcooling and operation without occupancy). New Internet of Things (IoT) products for a smart home have the potential for energy saving by reducing the unnecessary operation of the energy system in a residential house. However, many people still hesitate to adopt this product with uncertain economic benefit. This work explores a co-simulation platform to assess energy saving impact and economic benefits of occupancy driven thermostat in a residential house. An occupancy simulator was devised and utilized to consider the random nature of the occupancy in a typical single family residential house. Six HVAC system control strategies were explored based on three types of thermostats (always on; schedule based; and occupancy driven) as well as two setpoint control algorithms (fixed setpoint; and adaptive control). Energy-plus was integrated into the co-simulation platform, which evaluated energy consumption and indoor temperature of a residential house in five climate conditions. User's comfort level was evaluated using the adaptive model for the six different control strategies in each location. The result showed that the occupancy information-based control algorithm can save about between 11% and 34% of energy without significantly risking the occupant's comfort level. The work also suggests that the adaptive control model has a more tangible saving impact as IoT products can easily integrate outside temperature. Depending on the locations, adaptive control can save up to 54% of energy consumption, and the occupancy information can add additional energy saving impact by 20%. Payback period varies for different control strategies and depends on the rate of utility as well as the amount of energy saving. Compared with the most wasteful control strategy (fixed setpoint - always on), adding a thermostat with adaptive – occupancy driven control strategy can lead to less than one year of payback period regardless of location."

Although much research has been conducted to make up for weak points of heat pumps which occur when their purpose is converted from air-conditioning into water heating, there remain some points to be improved to perform as stably as conventional water heaters. Recently, the hybrid water heating system, which is the combination of a heat pump and a traditional gas fired water heater, is proposed as an alternative water heater to perform more efficient water heating stably. In this paper, the hybrid system is designed for general residential houses in Korea, which have floor area of 106.47m2 and its performance characteristics are analyzed numerically. To obtain the performance of a hybrid water heating system, the mathematical models of heat pump components and the correlation, which is derived from experimental data of a gas fired water heater, are applied. Also, using the result of a performance calculation, the economic feasibility study is carried out, with the concept of energy cost savings, to quantify the merits of the system and to establish its operation strategy. The monthly electricity and heat consumption data in a Korean residential house and the price of electricity and gas are applied to reflect an actual situation."

abstract={This paper proposes and analyses a new demand response technique for renewable energy regulation using smart hot water heaters that forecast water consumption at an individual dwelling level. Distributed thermal energy storage has many advantages, including high overall efficiency, use of existing infrastructure and a distributed nature. In addition, the use of a smart thermostatic controller enables the prediction of required water amounts and keeps temperatures at a level that minimises user discomfort while reacting to variations in the electricity network. Three cases are compared in this paper, normal operation, operation with demand response and operation following the proposed demand response mechanism that uses consumption forecasts. The results show that this technique can produce both up and down regulation, as well as increase water heater efficiency. When controlling water heaters without consumption forecast, the users experience discomfort in the form of hot water shortage, but after the full technique is applied, the shortage level drops to nearly the starting point. The amount of regulation power from a single dwelling is also discussed in this paper.},

abstract = "Ireland is currently striving to achieve an ambitious target of supplying 40% of electricity demand with renewable energy by 2020. With the vast majority of this being met by wind energy, an intermittent and non-dispatchable energy source, it is inevitable that frequent substantial curtailment will occur during times of excessive generation. This paper investigates the potential for demand side management to limit the requirement for curtailment and further facilitate the integration of renewable energy by shifting the timing of electrical demand in response to various signals including pricing and wind availability. Using a domestic dishwasher as an example, significant increases in the amount of renewable electricity consumed are demonstrated with simultaneous financial savings for the consumer. Furthermore, secondary benefits such as peak-time demand reductions in excess of 60% are observed. The impact of employing demand side management based on imperfect day-ahead market predictions is also analysed and the resulting deficiencies are quantified."

abstract = "Of the total electricity-generating capacity in the United States, 20% is dedicated to meet peak loads. Strategies to mitigate volatility in energy consumption have the potential to reduce the need for this surplus capacity. Here we investigate the potential for residential consumers to lower community-level peak demand through home energy management systems. We focus on the combination of air-conditioning use with the operation of time-shiftable appliances in the southern U.S. A centralized model predictive control (MPC) scheme minimizes peak air-conditioning (A/C) energy use by altering the thermostat set-points in individual homes. We simultaneously schedule the operation of time-shiftable appliances to further reduce the community peak load. The scheduling problem is formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) aimed at minimizing peak load under constraints that reflect the start times and allowed delays of individual appliances (e.g. dishwashers, washing machines, dryers) in each house. Using sample data collected from residential homes and consumer survey data located in Austin, TX, USA we show that the proposed integrated control and scheduling approach can minimize the peak load for the neighborhood by leveraging the physical differences and individual preferences between houses. On average, our framework is able to reduce the daily peak load for the group of houses by 25.5% (18.2kW) when compared with the load for individually controlled thermostat settings and appliance start times."

abstract = "Refrigerators have considerable share of residential consumption. They can be, however, flexible loads because their operating time and consumption patterns can be changed to some extent. Accordingly, they can be selected as a target for the study of Demand Side Management plans. In this paper, two experimental models for a refrigerator are derived. In obtaining the first model, following assumptions are made: the ambient temperature of refrigerator is assumed to be constant and the refrigerator door is remained closed. However, in the second model the variation of ambient temperature and door-opening effects are considered according to some general patterns. Further, two strategies are proposed to reduce the annual electricity cost and electric power consumption at peak-load times. These strategies together with the aforementioned models form an optimization problem which is, then, solved by Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm. Simulation results indicate a reduction of more than 28.61% in the annual cost. Also, the annual electricity consumption has decreased more than 20.46% and load shifting from the peak periods has achieved about 40%. In addition, these approaches are implemented in laboratory and their performance is confirmed by experimental results."

Four different dynamic shading control strategies with constant and variable set points were developed and studied in this paper using year-round transient integrated thermal and lighting simulation, to investigate their impact on outdoor view, daylighting metrics, thermal loads and energy consumption as well as on excessive illuminance that can cause visual discomfort in private offices. The strategies and generic and can be applied to any location, orientation and climate if appropriate set points are selected. The results showed that: (i) shades remain open for a significant portion of working hours depending on orientation and weather conditions (ii) controlling shades based on solar radiation as suggested in previous studies might not be an effective method; instead, illuminance thresholds are probably more appropriate (iii) the third control strategy leads to reduced source energy consumption and maximized daylight utilization; however, careful consideration of interior illuminances is needed to avoid the risk of glare; (iv) differences in annual source energy consumption between control strategies range from 10.1% to 34.4% depending on glazing and shading properties and (v) different strategies should be used in different orientations. Validation of results with full-scale experiments is presented for representative cases. The interactions and integration between daylighting benefits and thermal requirements need to be studied through the interplay between lighting energy use, solar and internal heat gains, while considering comfort parameters that vary depending on the shading control strategy used."

Using a simulation environment capable of modeling DIMs, a comparative analysis is carried out to evaluate the impact of DIMs on the heating and cooling energy end-uses for single-zone residential buildings in three US climates. Several design and operating conditions are considered to assess the performance of DIMs and their potential energy use savings. The results indicated that variable thermal resistance envelope materials (RSI-0.5/RSI-2.5) have the potential to reduce annual cooling energy use in residential buildings on average by 15% and up to 39% for all three US climates and annual heating energy use by 10% on average for mild US climates depending on the window sizes and internal heat gains."

abstract = "The current residential buildings are of light weight construction. As such, they tend to frequent indoor air temperatures fluctuations and have been proven detrimental for thermal comfort and mechanical system energy consumption. This is reflected in the energy consumption statistics for residential buildings. More than 62% of the building energy use is towards maintaining comfortable indoor conditions. Phase change materials (PCM); a latent heat thermal storage material, have the potential to increase the thermal mass of these buildings without drastically affecting the current construction techniques. In this paper, the potential of phase change materials is investigated through numerical and experimental studies. The field experimental study is conducted using twin side-by-side buildings exposed to the same interior and exterior boundary conditions, and EnergyPlus, after being benchmarked with the experimental results, is used for the numerical study. The numerical study is carried out for an existing residential apartment unit with particular emphasis on the effects of different design parameters such as orientation and window to wall ratio. Preliminary analyses of experimental data show that phase change materials are effective in stabilizing the indoor air by reversing the heat flow direction. In fact, the indoor air and wall temperature fluctuations are reduced by 1.4 °C and 2.7 °C respectively. Following, benchmarking of the numerical simulation shows confidence levels in predicting the interior conditions since discrepancies between experimental data and numerical data are within tolerance limits of the measuring device. Further, from the analysis of the numerical data, phase change material is effective in moderating the operative temperature but does not translate to significant thermal comfort improvement when evaluated over a night time occupancy regime in the summer. On the contrary, PCM is effective in lowering the heating energy demand by up to 57% during the winter condition."

Switchable insulation technologies are in their infancy and the emerging research on this topic is unstructured and fragmented across disparate application sectors and very few of the adaptive insulation concepts and technologies are actively being pursued by the buildings research community. The aim of this paper is therefore to advance the understanding of switchable insulation for possible applications in the building envelope, by reviewing and classifying the existing technologies systematically, with a particular focus on their working principles, theoretical performance and improvement opportunities. The paper provides a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the most promising switchable insulation technologies for building envelopes and identifies the opportunities for further research in each of the technologies."

Using a genetic algorithm (GA) based optimization technique, optimum R-value settings are identified for the DIMs throughout the year. These optimal R-value settings are selected to maximize energy cost savings when compared to traditional static insulated wall systems. It is found that optimal control settings for DIMs depend on several factors including building design and operation strategies as well as climatic conditions. Moreover, the optimal settings were found to depend on the orientation of exterior walls and well as the climatic conditions. Specifically, the analysis results indicate that north-facing walls are more active and frequently have to change their R-value in order to minimize the office building energy use and cost. When optimally controlled, DIMs could save up to 17% of annual heating and cooling energy costs for US office buildings."

abstract = "Dynamic Insulation Materials (DIMs) present an opportunity to reduce the energy consumption of buildings by allowing heat transfer through the envelope at times when it is beneficial. Studies in the past have investigated a binary R-value control in which the thermal resistance of the wall is either “on” or “off. This study attempts to improve on this control strategy by maximizing the amount of beneficial heat transfer through the envelope using wall surface temperatures, the heating/cooling set-point temperature, and the temperature in the middle of the wall as parameters. It is found that adding a period during which the R-value of the wall can vary continuously within a defined range has the potential to modestly decrease the heating and cooling energy consumption. However, it is found that the most energy savings can be achieved by using a 2-step operation with settings slightly modified from previous studies. For a parametric analysis specific to a residential building in Golden, Colorado, the optimized operation mode produced heating energy savings of 9.3% and cooling energy savings of 21.0% relative to static RSI-3.8 insulation. Moreover, a parametric analysis was conducted to extrapolate the findings to multiple US cities with different climate zones. It is found that the optimized operation mode offers some energy savings for residential buildings in all US climates, though the extent of the savings and the optimized parameters are dependent on climate. Specifically, climates with low cooling degree-days have the potential for a higher reduction of cooling energy up to 35%, while climates with low heating degree-days are found to have the potential for a significant decrease in heating energy of over 80% relative to static insulation."

In this analysis, SISs applied to roofs are controlled to minimize heating and cooling thermal loads for US housing units. Specifically, 2-step controls are utilized to switch the R-value of SISs between low and high levels depending on outdoor and indoor thermal interactions in order to reduce heating and cooling needs while maintaining thermal comfort within a prototypical one-story home located in different US climates. The analysis results indicate that SISs can significantly reduce energy consumption for heating and cooling systems. The energy efficiency effectiveness of SISs is found to increase for high reflective roofs and for high difference between the high and low R-values especially to reduce cooling energy needs for mild and heating dominated climates. In particular, the deployment of 2-step control strategies operating SISs can reduce annual energy use by up to 44% for space cooling and up to 17% for space heating."

EnergyPlus includes a number of innovative simulation features — such as variable time steps, user-configurable modular systems that are integrated with a heat and mass balance-based zone simulation — and input and output data structures tailored to facilitate third party module and interface development. Other planned simulation capabilities include multizone airflow, and electric power and solar thermal and photovoltaic simulation. Beta testing of EnergyPlus began in late 1999 and the first release is scheduled for early 2001."
